Introduction
-------------

CPLCom is a collection of utilities commonly used in the CPL
lab. It contains various Kivy widgets and tools. It also contains
wrappers of Moa devices for the hardware used in the lab.

With such wrappers, one can use these devices as generic devices with
experiments designed using the Moa framework. Such as the vet_cond project.

Usage
------

To use CPLCom, you first need to install it, see :ref:`install-cplcom`.

After it's installed, it can be used like any python library. 
See :ref:`cplcom-examples` for examples on how to use it. Complete API 
documentation is at :ref:`cplcom-root-api`.
